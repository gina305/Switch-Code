<h1>How to start a Cyber Security Career</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cybersecurity is a rapidly growing field with high demand for professionals who can protect computer systems, networks, and sensitive data from cyber attacks. If you are interested in starting a career in cybersecurity, here are three key areas to focus on: formal education, certifications, and job roles.</p><h2>Degree (Formal Education)</h2><p>A formal education is often the foundation for a career in cybersecurity. While a degree is not always required, it can help you gain the knowledge and skills needed to enter the field. A degree in computer science, information technology, or a related field is a great place to start. Some employers may also require a degree in cybersecurity or a related field, particularly for more advanced or specialized roles.</p><p>In addition to a degree, you can also pursue cybersecurity-focused coursework, such as certifications or online training programs. These can help you gain specialized knowledge and skills in areas like network security, digital forensics, or ethical hacking.</p><h2>Certifications</h2><p>Certifications can also be a valuable asset in starting a career in cybersecurity. Certifications demonstrate your knowledge and skills in a specific area of cybersecurity, and can help you stand out to employers. Some popular cybersecurity certifications include:</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>CompTIA Security+: A foundational certification covering network security, cryptography, and threat management.</p></li><li><p>Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP): A more advanced certification covering topics like access control, cryptography, and software development security.</p></li><li><p>Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH): A certification focused on ethical hacking and penetration testing.</p></li><li><p>Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA): A certification focused on auditing, monitoring, and assessing IT systems and processes.</p></li><li><p>Certified Information Security Manager (CISM): A certification focused on information security management, including risk management and incident response.</p></li></ul><h2>Job Roles</h2><p>There are a variety of job roles within cybersecurity, each with its own set of responsibilities and required skills. Some entry-level job roles you can pursue include:</p><ul><li><p>Security Analyst: Responsible for monitoring networks and systems for security threats and vulnerabilities.</p></li><li><p>Network Administrator: Responsible for maintaining and securing an organization's network infrastructure.</p></li><li><p>Cybersecurity Consultant: Provides advice and recommendations to organizations on their cybersecurity practices and policies.</p></li></ul><p>As you gain experience and additional certifications, you can pursue more advanced roles, such as:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Information Security Manager: Responsible for overseeing an organization's overall security strategy and operations.</p></li><li><p>Penetration Tester: Conducts ethical hacking and vulnerability assessments to identify weaknesses in an organization's systems.</p></li><li><p>Chief Information Security Officer (CISO): The top cybersecurity executive in an organization, responsible for leading the organization's overall security strategy.</p></li></ul><p>For more information on job roles any specialty areas within cyber security, see the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework">NICE framework</a>.</p><h2>DOD 8140 Certs</h2><p>If you are interested in pursuing a career in cybersecurity for the US Department of Defense (DoD), it is important to be aware of the DOD 8140 certification requirements. DOD 8140 establishes the requirements for all DoD personnel involved in information assurance functions, including cybersecurity. The certification requirements are organized into several categories, including:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Information Assurance Technical (IAT) Levels</strong>: These certifications are required for personnel involved in the day to day operations technical aspects of cybersecurity, such as system administration, security operations or vulnerability assessment. Examples of highly sought after IAT certifications include CYSA+ (<strong>Cybersecurity Analyst</strong>) and CISA (Certified Information Systems Auditor) certifications.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Information Assurance Management (IAM) Levels:</strong> These certifications are required for personnel involved in the management and leadership of cybersecurity programs. Examples of IAM certifications include CISM and CISSP.</p></li><li><p><strong>Information Assurance System Architecture and Engineering (IASAE) Levels</strong>: These certifications are required for personnel involved in the design, development, and implementation of secure IT systems. Examples of IASAE certifications include CISSP-ISSAP and CISSP-ISSEP.</p></li></ul><p>The following table outlines certifications sought after by DoD governed organizations (i.e. Army, Navy, etc.):</p><img src="https://images.surferseo.art/4a307e37-bd05-48da-8ee7-5df713425a0e.png" alt="DoD Approved Certifications"><p>In summary, starting a career in cybersecurity requires a combination of formal education, certifications, and job roles. Cyber security jobs typically require more than a high school diploma. Many organizations have positions varying from entry-level jobs to expert security consultant roles.Â By pursuing a degree, gaining certifications, and exploring job roles, you can gain the knowledge and skills needed to enter the cybersecurity field and work toward more advanced positions. Additionally, if you are interested in working for the US Department of Defense, be sure to familiarize yourself with the DOD 8140 certification requirements.</p><p>While starting a career in cybersecurity may seem daunting, there are many resources available to help you get started. You can network with professionals in the field, participate in cybersecurity events and conferences, and explore online resources and training programs. With dedication and hard work, you can build a rewarding career in cybersecurity and help protect organizations from cyber threats.</p>/div>
