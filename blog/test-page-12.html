Since 2010, Elasticsearch has quickly become the best-selling search engine and is commonly used in full text searches, data security and operational analysis use cases. Elasticsearch is a powerful search and analytics engine designed to scale horizontally and efficiently store, search, and analyze large volumes of data. Elastic Cloud is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy and manage Elasticsearch clusters in the cloud. In this article, we will discuss Elasticsearch and its use with Logstash and Kibana, as well as the basic architecture, sharding, and replication. In simple terms, Elasticsearch is a scalable search solution that allows searching data, such large volumes of data quickly.</p><p>Let us discuss the architecture and how Elasticsearch organizes data in its back end components.</p><h3>Elasticsearch Architecture</h3><p>Elasticsearch is built on top of Apache Lucene and consists of multiple nodes that form a Elasticsearch cluster. Each node in the cluster stores data and participates in search and indexing operations. Elasticsearch clusters can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster, allowing for greater capacity and improved performance.</p><p>Elasticsearch uses a distributed architecture to provide fault tolerance and high availability. The cluster is divided into shards, which are the basic units of distribution for Elasticsearch data. Each shard is a self-contained index that can be stored on any node in the cluster.</p><p>Elasticsearch uses a master-slave architecture to manage cluster operations. The master node is responsible for cluster-wide management tasks, such as creating and deleting indices, while the slave nodes are responsible for data storage and retrieval. A node refers to an instance of Elasticsearch, not a machine. Therefore, any number of nodes can run on the same machine. Whenever an Elasticsearch instance starts, a node starts running.</p><h3>Installing Elasticsearch</h3><p>If you want to get started, you can sign up for a <a target="\top" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="ulink" href="https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup?baymax=docs-body&amp;elektra=docs">free Elastic Cloud trial</a>. You can install it on any Linux, MacOS, or Windows machine. There are also options for deploying to <a target="\blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.6/docker.html">Docker</a> and <a target="\blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/index.html">Kubernetes</a> containers.</p><h2>Sharding</h2><p>Sharding is the process of dividing large amounts of data into smaller, more manageable chunks called shards. Elasticsearch uses a sharding mechanism to distribute data across multiple nodes in a cluster. Sharding improves performance and scalability by allowing Elasticsearch to parallelize search and indexing operations across multiple nodes.</p><p>In Elasticsearch, each index is divided into one or more shards, and each shard is stored on a separate node in the cluster. The number of shards per index can be configured at index creation time, and the default number of shards is five. However, the number of shards should be chosen carefully, as too many shards can lead to increased overhead and decreased performance.</p><h2>Replication</h2><p>Elasticsearch uses a replication mechanism to provide fault tolerance and high availability. Replication involves creating copies of each shard and distributing them across multiple nodes in the cluster. Each shard replica is stored on a different node than its primary shard, and Elasticsearch automatically handles failover and recovery.</p><p>Replication improves fault tolerance by allowing Elasticsearch to continue serving queries even if one or more nodes fail. In addition, replication improves performance by allowing Elasticsearch to parallelize search and indexing operations across multiple nodes.</p><h2>The Elastic Stack (ELK)</h2><p>Elasticsearch is a key component of the ELK stack. The “ELK” stack, after components such as Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana and now includes Beats. Although Elasticsearch is a search tool, its core users started to use the tool to collect logs and needed an efficient and reliable solution.</p><p>The ELK stack is a popular open-source solution for log management and analysis, and Elasticsearch is a key component of this stack. The ELK stack consists of Elastichsearch, Logstash and Kibana:</p><p>• <strong>Elasticsearch</strong>: Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine that is used to store and index data. It is the primary component of the ELK stack and is responsible for ingesting, indexing, and searching log data.</p><p>• <strong>Logstash</strong>: Logstash is a data processing pipeline that is used to collect, parse, and transform log data before it is sent to Elasticsearch. It can be used to filter and enrich data, as well as to parse unstructured data and convert it into structured JSON documents that can be indexed in Elasticsearch.</p><p>• <strong>Kibana</strong>: Kibana is a data visualization and exploration tool that is used to visualize data stored in Elasticsearch. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating dashboards, reports, and visualizations, and allows users to interactively explore, visualize, and analyze log data.</p><p>In the ELK stack, log data is typically collected by Logstash, which then sends the data to Elasticsearch for indexing and searching. Kibana is used to visualize the data stored in Elasticsearch and to create custom dashboards and visualizations.</p><p>The basic architecture of Elasticsearch in the ELK stack can be extended with additional components, such as Beats, which are lightweight data shippers that can be used to send data to Logstash or Elasticsearch directly. Additionally, Elasticsearch can be configured with a range of plugins and modules that provide additional functionality, such as security, monitoring, and alerting.</p><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/9781789803327/files/assets/a9a2dd57-5397-402e-8d94-fe8255664fb3.png"><p></p><p>Overall, the ELK stack provides a powerful and flexible solution for log management and analysis, and Elasticsearch is a key component of this stack. With its distributed architecture, scalability, and powerful search and analytics capabilities, Elasticsearch is well-suited for storing and searching large volumes of log data in real-time</p><h2>Use Cases for Elasticsearch</h2><p>Elasticsearch can be used for data analysis of index data s big data with a huge demand for Live Video feeds, the access of line of view data as well as the use of instant messaging services. Sometimes data needs to be literally sent across the globe, and sometimes the data can get pixelated. However, Elasticsearch has a way of solving this problem using a more regional approach. Elasticsearch enables a search engine platform and is commonly used to perform search and analytics functions on data quickly. is therefore ideal for these types of systems: Various systems and application systems can benefit from Elasticsearch and ELK stacks. A couple of use cases for Elasticsearch include:</p><ul><li><p>Search application — Applications whose data is primarily used by search platforms. For example, searches for websites. Sites with a lot of content find Elasticsearch an extremely useful tool. No surprise Elasticsearch gained momentum in many search domains.</p></li><li><p>Enterprise search Elastic Search — Elasticsearch allows the enterprise to search documents and products from all sources such as the Internet or blogs to anyone that is interested in finding them. It is currently in constant use and replaced search engines in most sites we use everyday.</p></li></ul><h2>Elasticsearch Query Types</h2><p>There are many possibilities that can be searched this way and you can mix and match several options for your needs. Elasticsearch 6.2 added the Elasticsearch filter and ES query types. In query clauses, the DSL defines filter conditions with queries contexts. Filtering can also be faster than queries, but queries can also be calculated depending upon the degree in which an article corresponds with the request.
